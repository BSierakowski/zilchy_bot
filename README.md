# RLBotPythonExample
Example of a Python bot using the RLBot framework

## Quick Start
The easiest way to start a Python bot is demonstrated here!

It shows you how to:
- Install the RLBot GUI
- Use it to create a new bot

## Changing the bot

- Bot behavior is controlled by `src/bot.py`
- Bot appearance is controlled by `src/appearance.cfg`

See https://github.com/RLBot/RLBotPythonExample/wiki for documentation and tutorials.

## Ideas:

- Faster boost stealing
- Speed flips
- maintain supersonic as much as possible
- Optimal kickoffs
-- kickoff priority
-- https://github.com/RLBot/RLBot/wiki/Useful-Game-Values
- Wavedashs
- demo, if your teammate is closer to the ball and you're supersonic, demo the closest 'enemy' car
- demo avoidance, if a car is going to intersect, jump over it
- recoveries
